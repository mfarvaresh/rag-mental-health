    "text": "I’m a former registered nurse. I used to advocate for patients in distress. I believed in the healthcare system. I believed in doing the right thing.\n\nBut when I had my own psychiatric emergency, I learned the hard way that those same systems don’t always show up for people like me—especially if your disability is invisible.\n\nIn 2024, after my provider tapered me off my psychiatric meds, I became severely overstimulated at work. I tried to do the responsible thing. I drove myself to a behavioral health ER in New Lenox, IL. I wasn’t violent. I wasn’t a threat. I was in distress. I needed help.\n\nThey admitted me—but later issued a warrant for my arrest based on behavior that happened during that mental health episode. I didn’t even know until I was arrested five months later—in another state—while still in active psychosis. I sat in jail for 30 days awaiting extradition. No care. No understanding. Just punishment.\n\nAnd it didn’t stop there.\n\nDespite being hospitalized and submitting a signed accommodation request from my doctor, I was forced out of my apartment. Management outright denied my disability. This, despite me receiving SSDI, having a well-documented condition, and being taken away by ambulance during a clear psychiatric emergency. They claimed my symptoms weren’t related to mental illness at all—they labeled it criminal behavior. I guess if you speak clearly and look “put together,” you’re not mentally ill. You’re just a problem to be removed.\n\nNow I’m stuck in limbo with the SSA. I applied for expedited reinstatement of my disability benefits nearly a year ago—after my trial work period failed and I had multiple hospitalizations. SSA policy says it should take 30 days. I’ve received nothing but duplicate letters falsely stating I’m employed and endless contradictions from representatives. I have to request critical payments monthly just to survive.\n\nI went from nurse… to criminalized… to forgotten.\n\nAll for doing what I was taught to do: ask for help.\n\nI’m posting this because I know I’m not alone. There are others out there with psychiatric disabilities who’ve been judged, punished, or ignored because we don’t “look” disabled. Because we’re too “put together” or “coherent” to be believed.\n\nIf this has happened to you, I see you. And I hope someday these systems will see us too.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "title": "My husband fell apart 2years after our children passed",
    "text": "To start this is a difficult subject for the both of us but it seemed to hit him (M33) harder than myself(F31). We've been married for 5 years met in highschool and been together ever since. Before we got married I got pregnant it wasn't the deciding factor but in the end it pulled us closer and we got married. Our first child was born before we married. After we married we tried for another and and were successful. We never fought and even rarely argued. He was always very social outgoing finding and doing everything new to him.\n2 years ago we were taking our oldest out for his 4th birthday. We were hit by a drunk driver in a large pickup truck on the rear passenger side. I was knocked out instantly and both of our children passed. And from what my husband told me  he wasn't lucky enough to be knocked unconscious. I was badly injured I'm still in physical therapy and will be for a while. My husband wasn't to badly injured physically he broke a couple bones that's it but mentally I don't know if he will ever recover. \nSince the accident he's be very distant to everyone except me kinda. We don't talk as much as we use to help won't let me go anywhere alone he wants to always be by me. He's always apologizing and just depressed. By no means wo I say I am over the passing of them but I think I have come to some what of terms with it. I've been trying to do everything I can to help with his mental state up until now but after listening what he went through I don't know what to do anymore this feels so overwhelming and beyond me. Last week would have been our oldest 6th birthday and I walked out and saw my husband just looking in to nothing and tears rolling down his face. This was the first time I've really seen him cry he's always tried to stay strong for me. I went to sit next to him to comfort him and he just laid his head on to my shoulder for a minute and like a minute later he just whispered help me. The sound he made speaking those words alone broke me. He refused to describe to me everything but to be honest I don't think I I could have handled it all. Apperatly after the crash he was still conscious and able to move. His first instinct was to try to pull us out. He went to pull the kids out but our youngest 2 took the full force and he couldn't tell what was what their wasn't anything recognisable to pull out. Our oldest wasn't in the car he had taken his seatbelt off sometime and had flown out the side. All he said was he picked up what he could find.\nI'm still trying to process this it almost doesn't sound real. I don't know how we're alive if that's what happened to them. I don't know how to help him. This is just so much. I don't know if I should be happy he opened up to me or horrified by what happened. What can I do? I'm just not sure anymore ",

    "text": "When I was 11 years old, my mother left me. Not in the dramatic way you see in movies—no police, no CPS, no frantic calls. Just absence. One day she was there, the next she wasn’t.\n\nIt wasn’t sudden if I’m honest. There were signs leading up to it. She would disappear for hours, sometimes days, claiming she needed “time to think” or that she was “just taking care of things.” But she always came back—until she didn’t.\n\nI remember the last day vividly. She made me eggs that morning. We didn’t talk much over breakfast, but there was something different about her eyes. Distant, like she was already halfway gone. She told me to “be good,” kissed me on the forehead, and left through the front door.\n\nI sat in that house for three days before I realized no one was coming back.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a test. Maybe I had done something wrong and this was a punishment. Or maybe she was trying to teach me how to survive without her. But as the days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, the narrative I built to protect myself started to crack.\n\nRelatives eventually stepped in—kind of. They fed me, clothed me, but no one really asked why she left. No one seemed surprised. It was as if everyone silently agreed: “She’s just like that.”\n\nI’m older now, but the shadow of that moment still lingers. I’ve replayed it thousands of times in my head. Was it my fault? Was it about her? Mental illness? Selfishness? Or survival?\n\nHere’s the question I can’t shake: Is there ever a situation where abandoning your child makes sense? Or is that always just a failure—plain and simple?",

My mind is blank most of the time, I can’t think clearly, and I’ve been stuck in anhedonia and depression ever since.\n\nIt’s like my brain just… shut down. No thoughts, no motivation, no emotion, just existing in this fog.\n\nI’m about to try Wellbutrin soon and I’m hoping it might help bring back some mental activity. Has anyone had success with it in a similar state?\n\nAlso, I’ve been wondering if a strict keto diet or any supplements/pills helped anyone with this kind of dissociation or mental shutdown.

    "title": "I survived a psychiatric emergency — but only barely",
    "text": "The Issue\n\nOn July 4, 2025, I suffered a sudden and severe mental health crisis triggered by an adverse reaction to an over-the-counter cold medicine. I was hallucinating, panicked, and rushed to the ER with a blood pressure of 190/100. I was discharged after six hours — with no psychiatric consult, no safety net, and no follow-up.\n\nWhat came next nearly killed me.\nFor three days, I couldn’t eat or drink. I begged for help. I reached out to my provider. I saw a psychiatrist. I told them the medications they prescribed previously caused serious side effects. I asked for lithium, a drug that had worked before.\nThe response?\n“Your next appointment is in three weeks.”\nI was in full psychological collapse — and told to wait.\n\nI’m not alone. This is happening across North Carolina and the United States every day. People in active crisis are being told to survive on their own until the system can “get to them.” Some don’t survive.\n\nWe demand change — now.\n\nWe call on North Carolina legislators and the NC Department of Health and Human Services to:\nMandate emergency triage protocols for psychiatric care.\n\n- Patients in crisis must be prioritized within 24–72 hours — not weeks.\n- Fund and expand bridge-care programs.\nPatients should receive short-term prescriptions or crisis stabilization while awaiting follow-up.\n- Hold providers accountable for medication safety.\nWhen patients report severe side effects, they must be heard and alternative treatments offered.\nTrain employers on trauma-informed response.\nEmployees experiencing mental health emergencies need compassion, not productivity pressure.\n Support caregivers.\nPartners, family members, and friends who hold us up through crisis deserve resources and recognition.\nI’m not asking for sympathy.\nI’m demanding action.\nI survived the waitlist — but just barely. Let’s make sure no one else has to.\n\n[Update - 7/25/25] Mental Health Leave, Medication Changes, and Fighting for the Right Help\n\nI wanted to post an update for those who read and supported my story recently.\n\nSince I first shared, I’ve officially gone on medical leave from work to focus on stabilizing my mental health. I was struggling with severe depression, panic, and what I now believe are long-standing effects of trauma and grief. The tipping point came after a manic and dissociative episode that led me to finally ask for real help.\n\nI’ve since seen my primary doctor twice (due to waiting for psychiatrist appointment), and finally today a psychiatrist. I am now on new medications: divalproex (Depakote ER), propranolol, and clonazepam. I’m early in the process, but already facing the usual uphill battle—side effects, slow progress, conflicting advice, and the emotional weight of not knowing what comes next. What’s been hardest is advocating for myself when I feel at my weakest, especially when I know in my gut that certain medications (like lithium) may be a better fit for me—but I’m not being heard yet.\n\nMy fiancée has been a rock through this. Without her, I’m not sure I’d still be fighting.\n\nTo those dealing with the system, waiting for appointments, battling stigma (maybe even from coworkers), and just trying to survive each day—you’re not alone. It shouldn’t be this hard to get help, but I see you. I’m still in it with you.\n\nThank you for giving me a place to be honest.\n",
