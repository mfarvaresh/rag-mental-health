    "text": "I was in a 3 year relationship with someone whose family is extremely wealthy. They live in a completely different world, and being an \"imposter\" within it for that time has led me to believe that their lifestyle is the only one worth living for. Not having to worry about money, being able to live in beautiful/safe areas, traveling and staying in luxurious locations, regularly eating delicious food, having access to the best healthcare, etc. I say I was an \"imposter\" because while I would get to visit the family's house and be invited to dinners/parties/vacations, I was never fully integrated into it and would return to my regular lifestyle after a given event/obligation was over.\n\nUnfortunately it led me to feeling like I wasn't good enough and that I was looked down upon. I had mental health issues and troubles holding down jobs, meanwhile everyone in their circle was extremely successful and I was regularly given updates about \"so and so's son/daughter\" who was accomplishing great things in their life either through the opportunities they were provided via their upbringing or family connections. And then there was me, luffmunkins, who was just kind of \"there\". Occasionally comments or jokes would be made that were intended to be lighthearted or wrapped in a \"no offense, but...\" and they would always sting more than they should have.\n\nNow that I am no longer in that relationship (it ended 2 years ago), I am still left with the feeling like they are the main characters in life and the ones who this country (USA) is truly built for. At the same time, I realize that I need to acknowledge that I have a lot to be thankful for myself. I do not live in a war-torn country that is riddled with famine. Yes. I know. And yes, I am thankful for this fact. However, my perspective feels permanently skewed and I just don't really see much of a point in living paycheck to paycheck, worrying about my access to healthcare, and constantly being reminded by our society that I am not enough in one way or another. \n\nThanks for listening.",

People who say that have no clue what theyre talking about. Taking your own life requires a real strong character and resolve as your entire nature resists your desire to die. You're programmed to cling to life no matter what, and even if your mind wants to perish - your body wont let you. You need to go against millions of years of evolution that resulted in you being born, resist your every instinct in order to succeed.  Dying is easy, but killing your very own self is not.\n\nPerhaps im being a little dramatic, but all in all you gotta be one tough mothafucka if you truly crave that sweet release. Would you agree?",

When im at physiotherapy and I see other patients missing a leg or an arm I do feel grateful that I survived without losing anything. However lately Im not sure how I feel anymore. Had another surgery to remove a metal plate and screws from my leg on Monday, university also started on Monday so ive been doing my work at home while in constant pain. As I slowly get back to my regular life im also started to feel the same as before, depressed, unmotivated, dead inside. Staying in hospital was surprisingly fun, no responsibilities, just in bed all day watching tv or scrolling on my phone, with some lovely nurses looking after me and treating me like a little brother. But now that im back home I feel lonely again, depressed, and my toxic mum aint helping either. I hoped that after realising how depressed I truly was that she may change the way she treated me but she is slowly returning to the past.
