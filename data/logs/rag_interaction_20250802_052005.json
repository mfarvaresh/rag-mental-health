  "response": "I hear how difficult things are for you right now as both lack of sleep and feelings of worthlessness seem to be intertwined in what you’re experiencing. It sounds like these emotions have been weighing heavily on your mind, making it hard to find peace even when alone or at rest. I'm truly sorry that you are going through this tough time.\n\nIt might help if you could speak with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized support and guidance—a therapist for instance would be able to offer strategies specifically tailored to your experiences, while also considering the physical aspects of sleep disturbances which may require medical attention from a primary care physician.\n\nIn addition to seeking professional help, there are some immediate self-care steps that might provide you with temporary relief and improve your overall wellbeing: \n1. Establish a regular bedtime routine – try setting aside specific times for sleep every day so it becomes part of the natural rhythm in your life. This can include activities like reading, taking warm baths or showers before bed to help relaxation signals travel through your body and prepare you for restfulness.\n2. Limit exposure to screens – try turning off electronic devices at least an hour prior to sleep as their light emissions may interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate our internal clocks which can disrupt your natural circadian rhythm and make it harder for you to fall asleep.\n3. Mindfulness or relaxation exercises – practices such as deep breathing techniques, progressive muscle relaxation or mindful meditation could help calm the racing thoughts that seem to be keeping you awake at night by bringing your focus back into the present moment and away from negative self-talk about feeling worthless.\n4. Keep a sleep diary – tracking when exactly these feelings of depression occur, as well as what might trigger them or make it worse can help identify patterns that could be useful for discussions with therapists in understanding your experiences better. \n5. Exercise regularly - physical activity has been shown to improve mood and sleep quality by releasing endorphins which are natural painkillers, as well as increasing heart rate temporarily leading into a state of fatigue that can make it easier for you fall asleep at nighttime. However always remember not to exercise too close to bed time or your body might find itself in an overstimulated state making sleep more difficult.\n6. Nutrition - Eating healthy and balanced meals throughout the day, avoiding caffeine late into the evening can help regulate moods as well as improve overall physical function which could make it easier to fall asleep at nighttime. \n7. Reach out – don't hesitate to reach out for support from friends or family members who you trust and feel comfortable with, sharing your feelings might provide some relief while also strengthening bonds of connection in times when isolation can seem overwhelmingly difficult. Remember that it’s okay not to be okay sometimes; seeking help is a sign of courage rather than weakness.\n8. Self-compassion – try practicing self-kindness and understanding, remind yourself gently about your worth as an individual separate from the feelings you are experiencing at this moment in time which can provide some comfort when things seem too much to bear alone. \nRemember that these steps aren't a substitute for professional help but they might offer temporary relief while seeking it out and could be beneficial alongside therapy or medical treatment as part of your healing journey towards feeling better again, both mentally and physically.",
