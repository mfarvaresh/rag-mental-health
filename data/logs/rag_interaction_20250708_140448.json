  "response": "I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but I'm glad you reached out. Depression is a serious matter and taking the step to acknowledge your feelings shows strength. While medication or therapy might not be accessible right now for whatever reason, there are immediate steps we can take towards self-care that may help alleviate some of these symptoms:\n1. Engage in activities you enjoy even if they don't seem appealing at the moment—it could provide a bit of relief and positive distraction.\n2. Maintain as regular a sleep schedule as possible; this can sometimes help regulate mood swings associated with depression.\n3. Try to connect with friends or loved ones, even if it's just for brief check-ins—social support is incredibly important when dealing with mental health issues.\n4. Practice self-compassion by reminding yourself that everyone has moments of feeling less than and those feelings are not a reflection on your true worth as an individual. \n5. Explore mindfulness or grounding techniques to help manage intrusive thoughts, like focusing deeply on the sensations in your body, breathing exercises, or even journaling about what you’re experiencing without judgment and with kindness towards yourself.\n6. Consider reaching out to a helpline for immediate support if things feel overwhelming—they're there 24/7 just to listen and offer guidance on next steps. Remember that these resources are confidential, non-judgmental, and available specifically because they care about helping you through tough times like this one.\nRemember though, it’s important not to self-diagnose or seek medical advice online without consulting a professional; if your symptoms persist for more than two weeks, please consider seeking the help of a mental health expert who can provide personalized care and discuss treatment options with you in detail.",

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.\n   Are they right, am I depressed?\n\nAnswer: The answer to the question of whether or not you're depressed, is less meaningful than what you are doing to feel strong and secure in your life.Otherwise, people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what they'd like to do with their lives, and accept \"depression\" as though it is their new name.What you write sounds like classic depression.What to do about this feeling is to get closer to yourself in an accepting way.",

I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.\n   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?\n\nAnswer: It sounds like you are having some pretty severe depression. Depression can cause insomnia, and make a person focus on their own perceptions that they are \"worthless\". It is important to remember that other people may not truly perceive you as worthless. This is the depression talking. I think that it is extremely important when you are this depressed, to sit down and write down some positives about yourself. What are your strengths? What are some positive things that your have done in your life?"
