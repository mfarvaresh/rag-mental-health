  "response": "It sounds really tough to feel anxiety and depression starting up so recently.  It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.  It's not easy when these feelings creep in, and it's brave of you to reach out for support.\n\nTaking care of yourself is key, and as the professional mentioned, looking at your daily routine can be a good starting point.  Think about your eating habits, sleep patterns, how much physical activity you're getting, your spirituality (if you practice it), and the time you're spending doing things you enjoy.  Little changes can make a big difference.\n\nCould you try keeping a simple diary for a week, noting how you feel in different situations and what you're doing at the time?  This might help you identify patterns – perhaps certain activities or situations make your anxiety worse.  Once you have a better sense of what's going on, you can start to make adjustments.  For example, if you notice your anxiety increases when you don't get enough sleep, maybe you could try going to bed a little earlier, and adjusting your eating habits to something nutritious.\n\nIt's also good to try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises.  Many apps can guide you through these, and they're often free.  Even just a few minutes a day can help. If you feel like your anxiety is becoming more intense, or if it's affecting your daily life, remember that talking to a mental health professional can really help.",

    "Question: I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.\n\nAnswer: Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds.",
