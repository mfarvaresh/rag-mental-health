  "response": "I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who is trained to support you through this. If you are in crisis or have thoughts of harming yourself please seek immediate professional help by calling your local emergency services (such as 911).\n\nIn addition, there might be online resources that can offer some comfort and guidance while waiting for a face-to-face appointment with someone who understands what it's like to feel this way. Websites such as BetterHelp or Talkspace provide access to licensed therapsists via phone calls or text messaging if talking in person is difficult right now, but please remember that these are not replacements for professional help and should only be used when you canâ€™t immediately reach a local provider.\n\nRemember it's okay to seek support from trusted friends or family members too; they care about your wellbeing as much as professionals do. Please take the necessary steps towards seeking assistance, whether that means calling someone close by for immediate comfort or finding professional help in person soon afterward. Your health and safety are of utmost importance.",
