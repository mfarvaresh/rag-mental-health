  "response": "I understand that experiencing a panic attack can be incredibly distressing and overwhelming. It's important to remember that while these attacks are very real, they cannot physically harm you; your body is simply responding strongly to the anxiety it feels. One immediate strategy could involve grounding techniques such as focusing on sensory experiences in your environment or practicing controlled breathing exercises—like taking deep breaths for a count of five and holding them briefly before exhaling slowly, repeating this cycle several times if needed.\n\nIt's also beneficial to learn these coping mechanisms when you are not feeling anxious so that they become second nature during an attack. There are various mindfulness practices such as meditation or yoga which can be very effective in managing anxiety and panic attacks, but it might take some practice outside of a crisis situation for them to work best.\n\nIf these strategies seem helpful on their own, you could consider joining an outpatient mental health group where skills like mindfulness are taught alongside thought reframing techniques that can help manage the intensity and frequency of panic attacks over time. These groups often provide a supportive community as well. \n\nAdditionally, consulting with a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant could offer you immediate relief through medication during an attack; however, it is essential to understand that while they can help manage symptoms in the short term, addressing anxiety often requires more comprehensive treatment like therapy.\n\nRemember, seeking professional help from a mental health provider for personalized advice and support tailored specifically to your situation could be very beneficial as well. They are equipped with evidence-based strategies that can provide long-term relief beyond just managing symptoms during an attack.",

    "[Professional Therapist Response]\nQuestion: I have a panic attack at least once a week and suffer from severe anxiety.\n\nAnswer: I'm sorry you're going through that. Panic attacks are terrifying.One thing to start with is knowing that panic attacks are not going to hurt you and your anxiety will come down with time. Fighting that process can sometimes heighten symptoms because your brain wants the message of panic to be heard. Some of the best ways to counter that message is through focusing on the present moment through sensations or breathing.",

If you decide to try some breathing techniques, try breathing in for a count of five, holding for a count of five, breathing out for a count of five, and repeating five times.Also remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when you're not having a panic attack. At that point, it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic. Also remember that panic attacks typically last 5 to 10 minutes.",

    "[Professional Therapist Response]\nnurse practitioner, physician's assistant, etc. Having said that, I certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with. If you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks, you should consider it. Medications can be helpful for anxiety, and medications like Xanax may help for immediate relief, but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety long-term.",
    "[Professional Therapist Response]\npay attention to internal sensations. There are also apps that can help with these techniques, such as Calm and Headspace. They work best when you aren't in a panic attack or when you feel one coming on. If you are already at the peak of an attack, they can still help, it just may take a bit longer. Some clients I have like to track their anxiety with a scale system. Let's say you scale your anxiety at an 8 out of 10, do some breathing exercises for 5 minutes, then scale it again."
