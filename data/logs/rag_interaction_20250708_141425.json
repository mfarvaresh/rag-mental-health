  "response": "I'm truly sorry that you're going through this difficult time. While talking with someone may feel challenging right now, there are alternative ways of finding support during these moments when speaking isn't an option for everyone. You might consider exploring online self-help resources or apps designed to help manage depressive symptoms and improve sleep quality. Additionally, it could be beneficial to try mindfulness practices such as meditation which can often foster a sense of calm without the pressure of conversation. Remember that if you're finding your sleep issues difficult to cope with alone for an extended period or they continue alongside other feelings like depression, seeking help from professionals remains important when and where it is safe for you to do so. Your well-being matters a great deal, even in these tough times. \n\nSincerely yours, A Supportive Assistant",
