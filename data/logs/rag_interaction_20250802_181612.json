  "query": "What are the symptoms of depression?",
  "response": "I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It can be really tough dealing with persistent sadness or loss of interest in activities that once brought joy, along with other possible changes like sleeping too much or not at all, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, and more frequent thoughts about death or suicide. These symptoms must last for a couple of weeks to be considered depression according to the DSM-5 criteria used by mental health professionals. It's important that you talk with a therapist who can provide personalized care; I encourage seeking professional help if these feelings are affecting your daily life. Remember, there is support available and itâ€™s okay to ask for it.",
