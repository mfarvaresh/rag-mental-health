  "query": "What specific metaphor does ACT therapy use to explain cognitive defusion with anxious thoughts?",
  "response": "I hear you say you’re feeling overwhelmed by anxiety and it's causing fear of the future or outcomes. It sounds like a heavy burden to carry on your shoulders alone. Cognitive defusion in ACT helps us see our thoughts for what they are - just words, not truths that must control us. Imagine each anxious thought as leaves floating downstream; you don't need to catch them or let them dictate the river’s flow of your life.\n\nIt might be beneficial to explore this concept further with a professional therapist who can guide you through ACT practices and help manage anxiety in ways that feel empowering rather than controlling it from within, like steering a boat on a tranquil lake instead of fighting the current river's flow. How does practicing viewing thoughts as separate entities sound to you?\n\nOne thing that might help is talking to someone you trust about these feelings, whether that's a friend, family member, or mental health professional.",

    "Question: I get so much anxiety, and I don’t know why. I feel like I can’t do anything by myself because I’m scared of the outcomes.\n\nAnswer: The are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with. One is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fight-or-flight response with more reasonable, accurate ones. As an example \"I'm scared of spiders.\" But if you change the thinking from being scared to \"I'm bigger than the spider,\" it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind. Mindfulness-based therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious.",
