    "abstract": "Subjective well-being has been implicated in the regulation of aggressive behavior, potentially through its influence on mood and neural processing. However, the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to elucidate the neural correlates of subjective well-being and examine its potential association with aggression using a two-part investigation. The first involved a functional MRI study (n = 111), focusing on amygdala responses to emotional face processing and broader cortical activation related to subjective well-being. The second involved a larger behavioral sample (n = 627) to assess the relationship between subjective well-being and aggression, as well as the mediating role of emotional variables. Behaviorally, subjective well-being was inversely associated with anger, hostility, and overall aggression, and with negative affect, anxiety, and depression. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant effects of mood (negative affect, depression, and anxiety) in linking subjective well-being to aggression. Neuroimaging results revealed that individuals with higher subjective well-being displayed attenuated amygdala reactivity to fearful faces. Additionally, intersubject representational similarity analyses demonstrated that individuals with similar subjective well-being levels shared more convergent neural activation patterns in visual (e.g., occipital pole, lateral occipital cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform) and the emotional network (e.g., insula), but not within the amygdala. These findings provide novel insights into the neuropsychological mechanisms linking well-being to emotional regulation and aggression.",

We evaluated the relationship between physical activity, physical performance, falls, and cognitive functioning at 1 year in 40 older adults living in 2 residential assisted living facilities in 2 communities in Wisconsin, USA. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty participants took part in the study, including 25 women and 15 men, with a mean age of 86.6 (±6.3) years. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) assessed cognitive functions, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale assessed depression, and Fall Efficacy Scale (FES) assessed fear of falling. Physical performance tests included the 10-meter walking test, 2-minute step test (2MST), and lower extremity strength and hand grip strength using a dynamometer. Additionally, posturography, using a portable Wii platform, Timed Up and Go test (TUG) test, and Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) assessed balance. RESULTS As many as 40% participants had at least 1 fall in 6 months. Significant deterioration in gait speed (P<0.0001) and mood (P=0.0137) over 1 year was noted. A significant correlation was found between number of falls and the 2MST (rho=-0.48), POMA and gait speed (rho=0.63), and the TUG (rho=-0.62), FES, and 2MST (rho=-0.54). The 2MST was the only significant parameter affecting the risk of falls in the study group (P=0.0118). CONCLUSIONS Among assisted living facility residents, a higher risk of falling was associated with decreased gait speed, impaired balance, decreased mood, increased fear of falling, and fewer repetitions performed in the 2MST.",

    "abstract": "The symptoms of long COVID (LC) can be debilitating and may be associated with anxiety, social stigma, and quality of life deterioration. Identifying patients at risk of LC is important to offer follow-up care and plan population-level public health measures. The current multinational study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of LC in the general population. We conducted an online, multinational, cross-sectional survey between April 2022 and January 2023, targeting participants 18 years and older with a previously confirmed COVID-19 infection. We used convenience sampling to recruit participants through an online Google form. We collected demographic data, past medical history, infection details, post-COVID-19 symptoms, and quality of life. Responses were then translated into English. LC was defined as per the World Health Organization. A single-variable analysis was conducted to identify factors significantly associated with LC development. Following the removal of multicollinear variables, a generalized linear model was established to estimate the contribution of different predictors to LC occurrence. A total of 11,801 respondents from 33 countries were included in the analysis. The mean age for participants was 32.7 ± 12.8 years, with 61% being females. BMI averaged 25.2 ± 4.8 across participants, and 14.8% of them were smokers. Seventy-eight percent of participants reported receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were then categorized into those with LC (N = 2335, 19.8%) and without LC (N = 9466 individuals, 80.2%). Our model identified 25 significant predictors. The predictors of higher LC risk included ICU admission (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.36, 3.18; P = 0.001), female sex (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.61, 2.02; P < 0.001), fatigue during the infection (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.43, 1.78; P < 0.001), identifying as Hispanic (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.26, 1.85; P < 0.001), and pre-existing gastrointestinal disease (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.22, 1.8; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we identified key LC predictors, including ICU admission, female sex, and acute fatigue as primary risk factors, while African American and Asian ethnicities and receiving even one dose of vaccination demonstrated protective effects.",

    "abstract": "Calbindin-D28K (Calb1) is a calcium-binding protein that regulates intracellular calcium signaling and neuronal excitability. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), Calb1 expression increases with granule cell maturation but is downregulated following chronic antidepressant treatment. To elucidate the functional relevance of this antidepressant-associated downregulation, we used an adeno-associated virus-mediated knockdown approach in mice to reduce Calb1 expression in the DG. Calb1 knockdown significantly reduced the expression of FosB, an activity-dependent marker, under basal conditions and impaired neurogenesis by suppressing neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and delaying neuronal maturation. Behavioral analyses revealed that Calb1 knockdown mice displayed heightened anxiety-associated behavior and reduced social interaction, whereas locomotor activity remained unaffected. These findings suggest that Calb1 expression in the DG supports basal activity-dependent responses, adult neurogenesis and emotional-social behavior. Paradoxically, while chronic antidepressant treatment reduces Calb1 expression, our results indicate that maintaining Calb1 may be essential for sustaining neurogenesis and proper emotional regulation. This discrepancy highlights the complexity of antidepressant mechanisms and suggests that Calb1 is a key regulator for enhancing hippocampal function and behavioral adaptation.",

    "abstract": "During the perinatal period, mental health issues and poor diet quality can adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes. Previous studies described associations between perinatal mental health and diet quality, but the direction of these associations remains unclear. Additionally, most studies lack insight into how these associations fluctuate within individuals over time. Therefore, this longitudinal, preregistered study in Dutch women (N=160) examined both between- and within-person associations between maternal mental health and diet from mid pregnancy to the early postpartum. In each of three waves of data collection, women reported on their mental health complaints (depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms) and dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire). Hair samples were collected to measure hair cortisol concentrations corresponding to each wave. Using random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we found no evidence for robust between-person associations between mental health and diet quality across the three waves. We did find associations between higher levels of mental health complaints and poorer diet quality at 18 weeks of pregnancy. Furthermore, the models did not show evidence for any within-person associations, indicating one person's mental health complaints did not predict later diet quality nor vice versa. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples are needed to replicate these results, including timing within the perinatal period and eating styles.",

    "abstract": "Nerve agents are lethal chemical weapons and highly potent chemoconvulsants. For the treatment of nerve agent-induced status epilepticus (SE), the FDA has approved the use of benzodiazepines-initially diazepam and recently midazolam (MDZ); however, benzodiazepines are not neuroprotective, particularly if not administered promptly. Here, we compared the antiseizure and neuroprotective efficacy of MDZ with that of tezampanel (LY293558; an AMPA/GluK1 receptor antagonist) administered with caramiphen (CRM; an antagonist of muscarinic and NMDA receptors), 30 min after the onset of SE induced by exposure of young-adult male and female rats to the nerve agent soman; neuropathology assessments were conducted from 7 days to 6 months post-exposure. Latency to suppression of the initial SE was comparable after MDZ or LY293558 + CRM treatment. However, seizures reoccurred, and MDZ-treated rats had longer SE, followed by significant neurodegeneration, neuronal and interneuronal loss in the CA1 hippocampal area and the basolateral amygdala, hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy, reduced spontaneous IPSCs in the basolateral amygdala, increased anxiety, and spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). MDZ-treated males had longer SE than MDZ-treated females and lower 24-h and long-term survival. MDZ-treated females displayed delayed hippocampal neurodegeneration and atrophy, as well as delayed SRS. Males and females treated with LY293558 + CRM presented minimal neurodegeneration and only delayed appearance of brain damage, without significant sex differences. The results suggest that MDZ treatment may carry higher risks for males. Replacing benzodiazepines with antiglutamatergic first-line treatments to prevent long-term brain damage and associated morbidities is overdue; LY293558 + CRM has produced remarkably promising results.",

BDCPP is a non-toxic compound against erythrocyes, U87 MG, and HepG2 cells. Wistar rats were subjected to a chronic stress protocol and treated orally with BDCPP. Behavioral assessments included the elevated plus maze (EPM), Light/Dark (L/D), forced swim test (FST), Morris water maze (MWM), and T-Maze. Biochemical assays measured corticosterone, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels. Western blotting was performed to assess the expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Using Golgi-Cox staining, histological evaluations focused on dendritic morphology in the hippocampus (CA3 region) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). BDCPP administration improved anxiety and depression-like behaviors, normalized corticosterone levels, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and increased the expression of BDNF and IGF-1 in the hippocampus. BDCPP attenuated stress-induced dendritic retraction in CA3 pyramidal neurons and mitigated hypertrophy in BLA neurons. BDCPP exerts beneficial effects against chronic stress-induced behavioral and neurobiological impairments, particularly by modulating the plasticity of the hippocampus and amygdala. These findings highlight its potential as a functional food-based intervention for stress-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) protocols have been widely employed to study functional neural connections along the cortico-spinal pathways and between interconnected brain regions. PAS protocols induce spike-timing-dependent plasticity, underscoring their potential as therapeutic neurostimulation tools. Cortico-peripheral PAS is based on the temporal pairing of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) and cortical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses, applied repeatedly at specific inter-stimulus intervals, to modulate the activity of the corticospinal tract. In contrast, cortico-cortical PAS involves the application of TMS pulses at two different brain areas to induce long-term changes in functional connectivity. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing PAS protocols and the factors influencing their effects, with particular emphasis on the critical role of the inter-stimulus interval. We trace the development of PAS from initial experiments in healthy subjects to its emerging therapeutic applications in various pathological conditions. We summarize current preliminary findings, discuss limitations, outline future directions, and review ongoing clinical trials. Although still in its early stages, PAS, particularly cortico-peripheral PAS, shows promising efficacy in motor recovery for stroke and spinal cord injury patients. Furthermore, initial evidence points to potential benefits in Alzheimer's disease and generalized anxiety disorders, supporting the expanding therapeutic scope of PAS protocols.",
