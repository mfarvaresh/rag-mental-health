    "title": "Should headspace Centres Offer Early Intervention for Eating Disorders? Outlining a Key Role for Australia's National Youth Mental Health Foundation in the Roll out of Accessible Care.",
    "abstract": "headspace is Australia's National Youth Mental Health Foundation. There are over 165 youth-friendly multidisciplinary services located in every state and territory across Australia. Considerable Government funds are allocated to headspace centres with the aim of targeting mild-to-moderate mental health disorders for young people aged 12-25 years. Young people present for help for a wide range of concerns including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, peer difficulties and substance use issues. Recent research has demonstrated that a high percentage of young people accessing care at headspace centres are experiencing significant body image concerns and are engaging in disordered eating behaviours. These include dietary restriction, binge eating and purging behaviours such as self-induced vomiting. The headspace centre model includes both general practitioners and mental health clinicians as part of the clinical team. This multi-disciplinary model enables centres to have the basic staffing needed to provide effective interventions for emerging and mild-to-moderate eating disorder presentations. While offering early intervention for eating disorders is within the scope of headspace centres, full integration of eating disorders care into the core business of headspace centres is still ongoing.",

    "title": "Depression and Anxiety in Patients with Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Evaluated by Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES).",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a swallowing disorder frequently assessed using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), which offers detailed visualization of swallowing function. While the physical consequences of OD, such as aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition, are well known, its psychological impact remains less understood. This study aimed to investigate how sociodemographic and clinical factors relate to OD and to evaluate levels of anxiety and depression in affected individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study included 63 patients who underwent FEES to evaluate swallowing function. Psychological status was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on FEES findings, patients were classified into 2 groups: group 1, impaired swallowing, and group 2, normal swallowing. RESULTS Impaired swallowing was identified in 38% of patients. These patients were significantly older (P=0.041) and predominantly male (P=0.005). BDI scores were significantly higher in the impaired group (P=0.044), indicating a greater prevalence of depressive symptoms. No significant difference was observed in BAI scores (P=0.282). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the normal swallowing group had a prior psychiatric diagnosis (P=0.013) and had received psychiatric treatment (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates a significant association between OD and depressive symptoms, underscoring the relevance of incorporating psychological assessment into routine clinical evaluation. These findings advocate for a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the physiological and psychological dimensions of swallowing disorders to enhance patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The college environment significantly shapes students' social development, yet many experience social anxiety that affects their mental health. Trait resilience has been identified as an important psychological resource that may influence how individuals regulate emotions and cope with stress, which could be relevant to understanding social anxiety. Focusing on college students, this study examines the extent to which trait resilience, emotion regulation, and coping strategies contribute to the mitigation of social anxiety, emphasizing their potential roles as mediators in this psychological process. This study surveyed 748 college students using questionnaires to assess their trait resilience, social anxiety, emotion regulation, and coping strategies. The data were obtained via an online questionnaire, employing random sampling of university students from different regions in China during the period from November 2024 to January 2025. The dataset was processed through SPSS, which was applied to carry out statistical descriptions, examine variable correlations, and explore mediating effects. The study found a significant negative correlation between trait resilience and social anxiety (r = - 0.486, p < 0.001). In the mediation analysis, the direct effect of trait resilience on social anxiety remained significant (β = - 0.173, 95% CI - 0.224, - 0.121). Additionally, cognitive reappraisal (β = 0.047, 95% CI 0.001,0.096), expressive suppression (β = - 0.019, 95% CI - 0.037, - 0.002), approach coping strategies (β = - 0.145, 95% CI - 0.185, - 0.107), and avoidance coping strategies (β = - 0.025, 95% CI - 0.045, - 0.006) all played mediating roles between trait resilience and social anxiety. This study shows that higher trait resilience has been linked to lower social anxiety, with emotion regulation and coping strategies playing key mediating roles. These findings provide a basis for designing interventions to reduce social anxiety in college students. Future research should focus on enhancing trait resilience and promoting positive emotion regulation.",

    "abstract": "Efficient brain-heart interactions, mediated by the central autonomic network (CAN), are crucial in regulating physiological and psychological stress. The ability of the autonomic nervous system to adapt to stress predicts resilience to cardiovascular, anxiety, and mood disorders. Since the neural dynamics underlying brain-heart interactions remain poorly understood, this study investigated brain activation and heart rate variability (HRV) during stress and relaxation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and peripheral heart rate assessment were used to assess brain-heart coupling during breathing-induced relaxation, psychosocial stress and stress recovery in 32 healthy participants. We assessed the relation between perceived stress and brain activation, and employed non-linear generalized additive models to forecast changes in HR based on brain activation in the CAN. Both breathing-induced relaxation and stress induction significantly affected HR variation and triggered brain activation in CAN-related regions. HR variation was related to CAN activity during stress induction, and that chronic stress was linked to reduced brain activation during stress recovery. Finally, we demonstrated that brain activation within the CAN predicts changes in HRV. Our results offer novel insights into dynamic brain-heart interactions during stress-related autonomic regulation and emphasize the brain-heart axis's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing stress resilience.",

    "abstract": "Sexual minority men (SMM) represent more than 50% of individuals living with HIV in the USA despite making up less than 5% of the general population. The advent of biomedical HIV prevention interventions has far-reaching benefits for SMM, potentially enhancing psychosexual health. We examined the relationship of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and Undetectable = Untransmittable (U = U) belief to psychosexual health among HIV-negative/status-unknown SMM. Participants (n = 351) were recruited via hookup apps and social media to participate in an online survey study in 2019-2020. Participants completed measures of PrEP use and U = U belief (the predictors), perceived HIV risk (the mediator), and psychosexual health (sexual anxiety, sexual esteem, and sexual satisfaction; the outcomes). The effects of predictors and their interaction were tested. Most participants were cisgender (99.70%) and White (71.22%). PrEP and U = U belief were positively correlated with each other and both were negatively correlated with perceived HIV risk. SMM who used PrEP reported more sexual esteem and satisfaction compared with SMM who did not. Indirect paths from use of PrEP (vs. non-use) through perception of lower HIV risk were significant relative to all three outcomes. U = U belief and the interaction of U = U belief and PrEP use were not significant direct or indirect predictors of psychosexual health. The findings suggest that it may be beneficial for public health messaging and healthcare settings to highlight the psychosexual benefits of using PrEP.",

    "abstract": "While researchers have emphasized the need to investigate pornography use in relation to normative or positive aspects of adolescent sexuality and understand differential susceptibility among users, empirical studies remain sparse. In response, this study investigated the link between pornography use and adolescents' sexual self-concept (i.e., sexual self-esteem, body-esteem, sexual anxiety, and self-efficacy). Specifically, it compared the sexual self-concept of adolescents who had used pornography with those who had not, while also examining how frequency of use, pornography-related sexual expectancies, and generalizations were linked to sexual self-concept in a subset of users. A sample of 1584 Canadian adolescents (49.3% cisgender girls; Mage = 15.53 years) completed self-report questionnaires about their sexual functioning. Significant differences in sexual self-concept were found between adolescents who had and had not used pornography, with gender-specific effects. Among those who had used pornography, higher pornography-related sexual expectancies were associated with higher sexual anxiety and lower body-esteem, while higher generalizations were associated with lower sexual self-efficacy. The findings emphasized the importance of incorporating positive and normative aspects of sexuality into adolescent pornography research while considering individual- and pornography use-related factors that could be linked to targeted outcomes.",

Twenty-six patients were enrolled at the Hospital where usually underwent for receiving their conventional therapy (CT) for CRF. Their positive and negative affect was measured by PANAS at baseline (before), after CT, and after CT in which a virtual museum visit experience (VR) was added, with a randomized cross-over design. Psychological distress, assessed as the evaluation of positive and negative emotion through PANAS scale, resulted in statistical difference among trait (baseline), CT and VR examination (p = 0.001), with specific difference between positive and negative poles (p < 0.001). Patients reported positive emotions for VR (mean = 28.1 ± 7.5) very close to the baseline (mean = 28.2 ± 8.1), suggesting a potential use of this technology as palliative treatment during CT. Psychological distress associated with CRF was shown to be reduceable by the museal visit fruition through the VR system.

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a common condition, yet multifactorial in nature. Our understanding of the interplay between clinical symptoms in relation to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and quality of life is limited. Our primary objective therefore was to identify features of TMD that contribute to anxiety and depression. Our secondary objective was to determine whether clinical symptoms, baseline characteristics, and mental health outcomes are associated with underlying disease severity, as determined by MRI. A retrospective analysis of 202 TMD patients was performed. Mental health outcomes were quantified using the Integrating Mental and Physical Healthcare: Research, Training and Services (IMPARTS) questionnaires, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and pain was judged by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Patients were categorised based on the severity of temporomandibular joint pathology (normal, anterior disc displacement with reduction, anterior disc displacement without reduction, and severe degeneration). On multivariate analyses, both higher anxiety (GAD-7) (p < 0.001) and depression (PHQ-9) (p < 0.001) scores on the IMPARTS assessment were associated with worst perceived pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Unilateral joint involvement (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.20 to 5.46; p = 0.018), locking (OR 4.28; 95% CI 1.63 to 13.63; p = 0.006), and clicking (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.60; p = 0.006) were significantly associated with increased odds of an abnormal TMJ on MRI, whereas higher anxiety scores (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; p = 0.006) and male gender (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; p = 0.012) were statistically significantly indicative of a normal joint morphology on MRI. Our findings support a complex interplay between patient symptomatology, mental health outcomes, and objective radiologically-defined joint pathology in the TMD patient population.",

    "abstract": "Cerebellum interactions with forebrain systems contributes to learning both cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and the cerebellum. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and cerebellum (CB) are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning the CS-US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. In the current study, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS-US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS-US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, both during stimuli and during the inter-trial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC-AM-CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC-AM-CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired trials to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.",

While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilised a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modelling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal grey was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.",

Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors (A1R and A2AR) suggest that each contributes separately to regulating anxious states. This study aimed to perform a comparative neurochemical analysis of these receptors in animal models with a genetic basis of anxiety. Male Wistar rats previously selected through the freezing paradigm and characterized as high (CHF) and low (CLF) anxiety-like responses were compared to the control group (CTL). Animals were submitted to behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and declarative memory, and to biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses to evaluate the level and localization of A1R and A2AR in the hippocampus. In the elevated plus-maze, the CHF group was more anxious than the control and CLF groups. No statistical differences were found in the object recognition task among groups. Biochemical analyses showed a significant increase in A1R content for CHF in the dorsal hippocampus compared to the control group. On the other hand, the ventral hippocampus presented a decrease in A1R level for CHF and an increase for CLF compared to the control group. Concerning A2AR, data showed that the CLF group presented an increase in the dorsal hippocampus and a decrease in the ventral hippocampus compared to the control group. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the differential level of adenosine receptors in the hippocampus may modulate different aspects of anxiety-like behavior.",

The effects of exercise on brain and behavior in association with SD remain to be further elucidated. This systematic review and meta-analysis appraised behavior and brain tissue alterations in rodents exercised before SD. Sleep deprivation was commonly induced using the flowerpot method. The partial SD protocol (REM sleep deprivation) was frequent (94.73%), and the multiple platform method (72h) was the most used for SD (89.47%). Treadmill-based physical exercise was common (89.4%) (4 or 5 times/week, 30-60minutes/session). Physical exercise reversed SD-induced anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. Specifically, BDNF concentrations were increased and 5-HT levels reduced, preventing the deleterious effects of SD. These changes occurred regardless of SD duration, exercise duration, intensity, time of day, brain region, or animal species. This meta-analysis demonstrates that there is sufficient evidence to state that engaging in exercise prior to sleep deprivation (SD) improves behavioral parameters as well as BDNF and 5-HT levels. This study significantly confirms the brain and behavioral impairments caused by SD and describes the beneficial and modulatory effects of physical exercise performed before sleep deprivation.",
