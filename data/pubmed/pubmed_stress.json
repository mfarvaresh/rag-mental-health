    "title": "Post-pandemic Inequalities: Evolutionary Anthropological Frameworks for Long-Term Impacts of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic.",
    "abstract": "The 1918 influenza pandemic was a major mortality event that is well understood in its proximate heterogeneous impacts, but its long-term impacts on inequality are less understood. Within anthropology, evolutionary frameworks such as the epidemiological transitions, biocultural anthropology, and evolutionary medicine can give meaning to ultimate explanations for pandemics' long-term consequences. I seek to identify and shape the gap in the 1918 influenza pandemic literature around the analysis of post-pandemic inequalities compared with pre-pandemic and pandemic period inequalities. I discuss six papers that address consequences on the demography and epidemiology of surviving populations and 11 papers that engage with the fetal origins hypothesis to understand unequal long-term impacts on cohorts exposed to stressful intrauterine environments during the pandemic. I contextualize existing knowledge of unequal impacts within evolutionary anthropological theory and argue that evolutionary anthropology is well suited to lead holistic research on ultimate determinants of long-term pandemic consequences.",

    "abstract": "The progression of atherosclerosis is driven by the interplay between vascular anatomy, hemodynamic forces, and endothelial responses. However, existing in vitro vascular models have yet to integrate all these elements into a cohesive, patient-specific system. Here, This study presents the first instance of direct 3D printing of a miniaturized, patient-specific carotid artery model that recapitulates anatomical-dependent hemodynamic changes and vascular cell remodeling. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from a healthy donor are used to generate miniaturized 3D carotid artery models, which are analyzed via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) to validate the preservation of physiological hemodynamic properties. Using digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, the miniaturized carotid artery vessel is fabricated using gelatine methacrylate (GelMA) containing embedded human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMCs) and an endothelialized lumen with human aortic endothelial cells (hAECs). Perfusion culture replicated physiological arterial shear stress of up to 10 dynes cm",

    "title": "Characterization of Flow Structure and Wall Shear Stress in Patient-Specific Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Phantom using Particle Image Velocimetry.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is an irreversible dilation of the abdominal aorta that carries significant risk of rupture if not adequately screened and treated. This condition poses severe threat, with mortality rate exceeding 80% in certain age groups. The enlargement of abdominal aorta leads to notable hemodynamic alterations in AAAs, characterized by flow separation and vortical structures. Current understanding acknowledges a correlation between growth and rupture mechanisms of AAA and disturbed hemodynamics, emphasizing metrics such as time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), endothelial cell activation potential (ECAP), and relative residence time (RRT). In this study, we utilized a quantitative velocity measurement technique, particle image velocimetry (PIV), to characterize the flow structure and wall shear stress in a patient-specific aneurysmal abdominal aorta phantom. Phase-averaged flow fields for 12 phases of physiological flow are investigated, constructing velocity contours, streamline patterns, vorticity contours, and swirling strength contours in AAA at three different PIV planes. In addition, a method previously developed and validated to extract wall shear stress from PIV measurements is applied to obtain shear stress indexes, including TAWSS, OSI, ECAP, and RRT. The progression of vortex structures in the bulge along with flow separation and reattachment zones in relation to the shear stress indexes are presented and discussed in detail. Here we present in detail generating AAA phantoms from patient CT images, and PIV based flow examination through the phantom, which will contribute to experimental investigations for understanding the influence of disturbed hemodynamics on AAA biomechanics.",

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases cause early death and financial strain worldwide. Cardio-metabolic health, crucial for preventing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, may benefit from bilberry's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This meta-analysis reviews studies of bilberry's impact on lipid profiles, glycemic indices, body composition, and inflammatory and oxidative factors. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials assessing bilberry supplementation in adults for at least 1 week. A comprehensive review of literature was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar until July 21, 2024, without any time limitations. Mean changes and their SDs were used to calculate overall effect sizes, with the Hozo et al. method converting SEs, 95% CIs, and IQRs to SDs. A random-effects model accounted for between-study variations. Eleven RCTs, including 409 individuals, were incorporated into the present systematic review, and 8 were included in the meta-analysis. Combining five effect sizes from the five trials on long-term effects of bilberry administration compared with controls resulted in a non-significant decrease in FBG (WMD: -0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.07, p = 0.30). For HbA1c, the meta-analysis of three RCTs showed a marginally significant reduction (WMD: -1.63%, 95% CI: -3.36% to 0.11%, p = 0.06). The results of the meta-analysis on lipid profile showed a decreasing trend, although this reduction was not statistically significant for TC (WMD: -0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.30% to 0.08%, p = 0.27) or TG (WMD: -0.07 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.32% to 0.19%, p = 0.62). However, a significant change in TG was reported in trials with a crossover design and RCTs with 4 weeks of intervention or less. Although HDL level did not show any significant change (WMD: -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.10% to 0.07%, p = 0.70), the meta-analysis of five RCTs evaluating the long-term effects of bilberry supplementation revealed a significant change in LDL following bilberry supplementation (WMD: 0.07 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.01%-0.14%, p = 0.01). Furthermore, no significant reduction was observed in SBP (WMD: -2.75 mmHg, 95% CI: -6.38% to 0.89%, p = 0.13) or DBP (WMD: -1.00 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.66% to 2.65%, p = 0.59) after bilberry supplementation. Finally, anthropometric indices including body weight (WMD: 0.04 Kg, 95% CI: -0.44% to 0.53%, p = 0.86) and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers including hs-CRP (WMD: -8.22 mg/L, 95% CI: -20.24% to 3.81%, p = 0.18), IL-6 (WMD: -7.19 pg/mL, 95% CI: -19.01% to 4.63%, p = 0.23), uric acid (WMD: -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.03% to 0.01%, p = 0.36), and FRAP (WMD: -42.03 μmol/L, 95% CI: -100.54% to 16.48%, p = 0.16) showed no significant change after bilberry supplementation. Bilberry supplementation may have beneficial effects on HbA1c and TG, but not other cardio-metabolic indices. Therefore, long-term and high-quality trials are needed to confirm the promising effects of bilberries.",

According to minority stress theory, societal stigma adversely impacts health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals. This study focused on improving health outcomes for bi+ men, a group that has received little focus in the literature outside of focusing on sexual health. The current intervention aimed to help bi+ men process through previous biphobic experiences by exploring two interventions, psychoeducation and emotion focused writing, and evaluated their effectiveness in reducing the impact of biphobic events. To evaluate intervention effectiveness, we measured participants' identity-related concerns, trauma/stressor symptoms, depression levels and gender role norms before and after completing one of the two interventions. Overall, the results suggest that both interventions may be helpful in reducing the impact of biphobic events and improving health outcomes for bi+ populations, with intervention differences in gender role conflict and internalized biphobia. These interventions could be a helpful supplement or alternative to individual therapy to process through biphobic experiences.",

However, effective treatments are hindered by challenges in drug delivery to the central nervous system, primarily due to the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we investigated the potential of rosuvastatin-loaded nanoemulsions for neuroinflammation treatment. The mean diameter and zeta potential of developed RSV-NEs were 124.8 ± 1.23 nm and -40.5 ± 3.2 mV, respectively. TEM analysis revealed the spherical morphology and uniformity of nano-droplets. A cell viability study on the PC12 cell line confirmed the safety of RSV-NEs up to the concentration of 300 µg/mL. The protective efficacy of orally administrated RSV-NEs against LPS-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress was assessed in SD rats. According to histopathological assessments, LPS-induced damage was prevented by RSV-NEs through a neuroprotective effect linked to a reduction in GFAP",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke (IS) is a prevalent and serious neurological disorder, and is one of the major contributors to mortality and disability worldwide. The activation of autophagy and the inflammatory response following cerebral ischemia are crucial in the progression of IS. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A), as a stress-responsive protein, has been proven to be closely associated with autophagy. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of PPP1R15A in IS remains to be fully understood. Our study screened PPP1R15A as a candidate gene by bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IS and autophagy-related genes (ARGs). Functionally, experiments uncovered that down-regulation of PPP1R15A alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-mediated inhibition of cell viability and promotion of LDH release, cell apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation in A172 and SH-SY5Y cells. Simultaneously, silencing PPP1R15A ameliorated the IS progression in the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model. Furthermore, PPP1R15A activated the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in vivo and in vitro. Rescue experiments indicated that TLR4 inhibitors TAK-242 and NF-κB inhibitors BAY-11-7082 effectively alleviated the malignant progression of IS mediated by overexpression of PPP1R15A. Our data illustrated that PPP1R15A promoted OGD/R-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation by activating the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.",

    "title": "Perceptions of mental health literacy, stigma, empathy, and confidence in managing patients with psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses working in a Singapore emergency department.",
    "abstract": "In line with the global rise in mental health disorders, Singapore has experienced a notable increase in prevalence, from 13.4% in 2020 to 17% in 2022. Despite strategic efforts to strengthen mental health services, such as expanding the workforce of psychiatrists and psychologists and integrating care into primary healthcare settings, the Emergency Department (ED) faces escalating numbers of patients with psychiatric disorders. This surge leads to heightened workloads, stress, and burnout among healthcare professionals. This study explores the perceptions of mental health literacy, stigma, empathy, and confidence in managing patients with psychiatric disorders among doctors and nurses working in Singapore's EDs. Questionnaires used include the Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS) to assess mental health literacy, the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers-15 (OMS-HC-15) to measure attitudes toward mental illness, and the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) to measure empathy. In the last quarter of 2021, 47 doctors and 63 nurses from the ED at a general restructured hospital in Singapore, who had worked for at least 4 months in the ED, completed the survey. The anonymous survey included the above-validated questionnaires and two original questionnaires that assessed confidence in managing patients with psychiatric disorders and their familiarity with the local Mental Health Care and Treatment Act (MHCTA). Differences between doctors and nurses for all categorical variables, including demographic data and the questionnaire responses of interest, were analysed. Findings reveal that doctors scored higher in mental health literacy (MHLS score of 121.89 to 118.27) and empathy (JSE score of 109.32 to 101.44) and lower in stigma than nurses (OMS-HC-15 score of 41.98 to 43.57). Furthermore, Singaporean ED professionals scored lower on these dimensions than their counterparts in Western countries but outperformed those in East Asia. The unique roles of doctors and nurses, coupled with Singapore's distinct sociocultural context, likely contribute to these variations. Both groups demonstrated moderate confidence in handling patients with psychiatric disorders but emphasised the need for further training. These insights underscore the importance of implementing systemic policies and targeted training programmes to improve mental health care, reduce stigma, and enhance empathy and confidence among ED professionals.",

This study offers convincing and reliable evidence supporting the beneficial effects of greenspace exposure on intestinal health, through a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between greenspace and intestinal disorders. The Greenspace exposure was primarily assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and residential proximity to greenspaces. A comprehensive assessment was conducted concurrently by integrating various methods, such as land-use and satellite image data. This research encompassed a variety of intestinal conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and diarrhea. A search was performed cross four English and two Chinese databases, yielding nine studies for systematic review and eight for meta-analysis from 11,497 identified records. The results illustrated a significant protective effect of greenspaces against CD and IBD as well as a potentially protective effect against diarrhea. Nonetheless, no significant association was detected for UC or CRC. The study established that greenspaces could influence intestinal health through potential mechanisms such as improved air quality, enhanced microbial diversity, and reduced stress. These findings provide a solid basis for developing healthier urban environments and advancing strategies for prevention and treatment of intestinal diseases.Trial registration Registration number: CRD42024625968.",

Trait resilience has been identified as an important psychological resource that may influence how individuals regulate emotions and cope with stress, which could be relevant to understanding social anxiety. Focusing on college students, this study examines the extent to which trait resilience, emotion regulation, and coping strategies contribute to the mitigation of social anxiety, emphasizing their potential roles as mediators in this psychological process. This study surveyed 748 college students using questionnaires to assess their trait resilience, social anxiety, emotion regulation, and coping strategies. The data were obtained via an online questionnaire, employing random sampling of university students from different regions in China during the period from November 2024 to January 2025. The dataset was processed through SPSS, which was applied to carry out statistical descriptions, examine variable correlations, and explore mediating effects. The study found a significant negative correlation between trait resilience and social anxiety (r = - 0.486, p < 0.001). In the mediation analysis, the direct effect of trait resilience on social anxiety remained significant (β = - 0.173, 95% CI - 0.224, - 0.121). Additionally, cognitive reappraisal (β = 0.047, 95% CI 0.001,0.096), expressive suppression (β = - 0.019, 95% CI - 0.037, - 0.002), approach coping strategies (β = - 0.145, 95% CI - 0.185, - 0.107), and avoidance coping strategies (β = - 0.025, 95% CI - 0.045, - 0.006) all played mediating roles between trait resilience and social anxiety. This study shows that higher trait resilience has been linked to lower social anxiety, with emotion regulation and coping strategies playing key mediating roles. These findings provide a basis for designing interventions to reduce social anxiety in college students. Future research should focus on enhancing trait resilience and promoting positive emotion regulation.",

This study investigated unreinforced stone masonry walls, a common type of URM, strengthened using FRP and CFM materials in different configurations, focusing on the walls' in-plane shear behavior under diagonal compression testing. A reference specimen, labeled URM-1, was constructed without reinforcement. FRP materials were applied to two specimens either horizontally or diagonally on both wall surfaces. Similarly, two specimens were strengthened on both surfaces using CFM, applied with either epoxy or repair mortar. Based on experimental and analytical results, the URM-5 specimen (CFM with epoxy) was identified as the most effective strengthening method. It significantly increased maximum load capacity, shear stress, ductility, and elastic stiffness. Additionally, the URM-5 specimen reduced wall fragility and maintained structural integrity during fracture.",

    "abstract": "The lumbar spine and pelvis are critical stress-bearing structures of the human body, and their rapid and accurate segmentation plays a vital role in clinical diagnosis and intervention. However, conventional CT imaging poses significant challenges due to the low contrast of sacral and bilateral hip tissues and the complex and highly similar intervertebral space structures within the lumbar spine. To address these challenges, we propose a general-purpose segmentation network that integrates a cross-scale feature fusion strategy with a linear self-attention mechanism. The proposed network effectively extracts multi-scale features and fuses them along the channel dimension, enabling both structural and boundary information of lumbar and pelvic regions to be captured within the encoder-decoder architecture.Furthermore, we introduce a linear mapping strategy to approximate the traditional attention matrix with a low-rank representation, allowing the linear attention mechanism to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining segmentation accuracy for vertebrae and pelvic bones. Comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the CTSpine1K and CTPelvic1K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 1.5% in Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 2.6% in Hausdorff Distance (HD) over state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing boundary segmentation quality and segmentation accuracy in homogeneous anatomical regions.",
