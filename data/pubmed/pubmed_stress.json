    "title": "Metallothioneins in the Pathogenesis of Liver Diseases: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Metallothioneins (MTs) are primarily known for maintaining cellular metal homeostasis and protecting against metal toxicity, but they also play critical roles in mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. Reduced MTs expression is associated with disease progression in several chronic hepatic disorders. In metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MT1 downregulation has been linked to the transition from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Additionally, evidence suggests that individuals with low MTs expression may be more susceptible to obesity, which is one of the key drivers in the development of MASLD. In chronic viral hepatitis, in vivo MTs downregulation contrasts with acute-phase in vitro upregulation, suggesting an effect of persistent inflammation. MTs downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates with poor prognosis, positioning MTs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In contrast, increased MTs expression may play a protective or diagnostically informative role in other conditions. In alcoholic hepatitis, MT1 overexpression contributes to defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. In Wilson's disease, MTs demonstrates prominent hepatic expression and may offer diagnostic value alongside traditional markers such as rhodanine staining. In cholestatic liver diseases like PBC and PSC, MTs expression correlates with disease progression. This review highlights the emerging role of MTs in liver disease pathogenesis and positions them as promising molecular tools that may inform future strategies for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "Berberine (BBR), a naturally occurring compound with diverse medicinal properties, is emerging as a compelling candidate for managing age-related central nervous system conditions. Preclinical studies have extensively explored its impact on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, revealing its capacity to modulate key pathological processes. Mechanistically, BBR is shown to mitigate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby reducing neuronal damage and apoptosis. While these mechanistic insights and preclinical data are robust, clinical evidence remains nascent, necessitating further rigorous investigation to fully understand BBR's therapeutic efficacy and translate its promise into clinical practice. This narrative review provides a comprehensive examination of BBR's application in treating neurological conditions, emphasizing its molecular signaling pathways and critically evaluating the current translational landscape. It also identifies promising directions for future research into BBR's neuroprotective roles.",

    "title": "Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms of Epigallocatechin Gallate: An Updated Review on Clinical Trials.",
    "abstract": "Human physiology is a complex process encompassing various biochemical mechanisms, regulated by hundreds of chemical mediators, thus making it more complicated to understand. Balance between these mediators is mandatory to continue the helm of life; however, an imbalance can disrupt normal physiological functions and lead to chronic health conditions. Cancer is one such chronic state that occurs due to an imbalance or overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which are highly unstable and damage other chemical constituents in the body. The mutilation at the cellular level results in DNA and genetic mutation, uncontrolled cell proliferation, metastasis, organ dysfunction, and ultimately mortality. Various types of cancers are intimidating human life globally, and lung cancer is leading them all, followed by breast and colorectal cancer. Oxidative stress (OS) is the main root cause of cancers that occur due to overproduced RONS. Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) like p53, PTEN, INK4, MADR2, APC, and oncogenes such as HER2, BCR/ABL1, CMYC, EML4AK, RAS, WNT, ERK, and TRK get mutated by OS. Moreover, various pro-inflammatory markers i.e., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β and growth factors (VEGF, EGF, IGF-2) are also involved in cancer progression. Along with these aspects, the oncogenesis involves different signaling pathways/axis such as MAPK, PI3K, mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, GSK3, and NF-κB. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a bioactive compound abundantly existing in green tea and grapes with strong antioxidant activity and anticancer potential, is a suitable approach to reduce the cancer burden. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer studies of EGCG proved anticancer and anti-tumor effects through modulation of cancer signaling pathways, reduction in cell proliferation, decreased metastasis, suppressed angiogenesis, enhanced antioxidant activity, inhibited pro-inflammatory biomarkers, improved TSGs expression, and downregulated oncogenes expression. Shortly, the current review focuses on the anticancer potential of EGCG through possible mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a complex, multifactorial cardiovascular disease characterized by lipid accumulation, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Conventional therapies, including lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory agents, offer limited efficacy due to inadequate lesion targeting, low bioavailability, and systemic side effects. Nanozymes, which engineered nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-mimetic catalytic activities have recently emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy capable of simultaneously modulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism. This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in nanozyme-based interventions for AS, focusing on representative systems such as Prussian blue, cerium oxide, selenium-based, and multifunctional composite nanozymes. We critically discuss their design principles, catalytic mechanisms, lesion-targeting strategies, and therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models. Additionally, we highlight key translational challenges, including biosafety concerns, pharmacokinetic limitations, and manufacturing standardization, which currently impede clinical application. By integrating catalytic activity with targeted delivery and microenvironment-responsive functionalities, nanozymes offer a promising paradigm for precision therapy in AS. Future research should prioritize enhancing biocompatibility, optimizing therapeutic specificity, and establishing scalable, reproducible fabrication methods to facilitate clinical translation. This review aims to provide a systematic framework and insightful guidance for advancing nanozyme-based therapeutics toward clinical application in cardiovascular disease management.",

    "abstract": "DNA can be protonated in an acidic microenvironment and therefore may undergo denaturation. Specially, during photodynamic therapy, which usually proceeds via oxidation and nitration of the DNA bases of the cancer cells, protonation may result in DNA structural deformation and consequently accelerate its denaturation and destruction. In the present study, the effect of the protonation of cytosine (at N3), along with the oxidation/nitration of guanine, on the structural instability and possible denaturation of the double-strand dodecamer B-DNA has been investigated using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations. Results of these RMD simulations show that protonation has a larger impact on the oxo/nitro-modified B-DNA as compared to that on its pristine structure. In addition, cytosine protonation (at N3) imposes higher stress on the dodecamer structure in the modified 8-nitroguanine B-DNA system compared to that in the other two modified systems, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole and 8-oxoguanine B-DNA. Detailed analysis of the results of the RMD simulations shows that protonation of modified 8-nitroguanine B-DNA results in a higher structural fluctuation such that the number of the interstrand hydrogen bonds decreases and water molecules find larger spaces to diffuse into the weakened double-strand structure and cause further expansion (both in width and length) of the B-DNA structure. While all modifications and protonations have been applied on the GC nucleobase pairs of the B-DNA molecule, their effects are more evident over the farther AT (7th) nucleobase pair, which belongs to the GAATTC section of the B-DNA double helix named ",

    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a significant complication of sepsis, wherein the interaction between pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and immune cells plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis. In this study, it is demonstrated that secretion of chemokine C-C motif ligand 7 (CCL7) by endothelial cells (ECs) induces metabolic reprogramming and M1 polarization of C-C motif chemokine receptor 1-positive (CCR1⁺) macrophages. It is noteworthy that mice with specific inhibition of endothelial-derived CCL7 exhibit reduced severity of septic ALI, underscoring the critical role of CCL7 in the progression of sepsis. Mechanistically, activation of the CCL7-CCR1 axis enhances STAT1 succinylation through upregulation of KAT2A expression, leading to increased STAT1 binding to the promoter of glycolytic genes in macrophages. This epigenetic regulation modulates metabolic reprogramming and M1 polarization of macrophages, thereby driving inflammatory cascades in septic ALI.

    "abstract": "Artificial synaptic devices that mimic neuromorphic signal processing hold great promise for bioelectronic interfaces. However, most systems remain limited to physical stimuli or electroactive small molecules, lacking the ability to transduce biologically relevant protein signals. To address this limitation, an aptamer-mediated aqueous artificial synaptic transistor is developed capable of selectively responding to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) signal, a specifically expressed protein of inflammatory stress, via gate-voltage-induced synaptic modulation in biologically relevant electrolyte environments. Guided by molecular docking simulations, high-affinity aptamer sequences are identified for robust recognition of IL-6. The device demonstrates precise IL-6 capture and translation into neuromorphic electrical signals across various biological electrolytes (PBS, albumin, serum), with linear detection from 0.5 pm to 50 nm. Moreover, the device can convert IL-6 binding events into time and concentration-dependent electrical outputs, exhibiting significant synaptic plasticity and memory retention. When implanted into the caudal vein of sepsis mice, the device stably monitors IL-6 level and maintains reliable synaptic response to inflammatory-triggered elevations. Machine learning analysis enables accurate discrimination between normal and pathological states from device-generated signals. By bridging biochemical signals with neuromorphic encoding, this system outlines a conceptual framework for future integration between artificial and biological neural units, contributing to the hybrid neurosensory systems.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological condition that affects around 50 million people globally. While the underlying mechanism of epilepsy is not fully understood, emerging evidence demonstrates that inflammation is a key player in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. MicroRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, particularly through regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. In this systematic review, we analyzed and summarized data from the literature regarding the role of inflammatory miRNAs in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, through human and animal studies. Twenty one reports on humans and 44 reports on animals were included in the current analysis. Kainic acid (KA) and pilocarpine were broadly used approaches in inducing epilepsy in animal models. Among upregulated microRNAs, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-132 were more emphasized for their inflammatory role involved in epilepsy. MiR-221, miR-222, and miR-29a were downregulated and were associated with anti-inflammatory effects. Notably, microRNAs demonstrated tissue-specific expression patterns in different samples, including brain cortex, hippocampus, and body fluids, which is considerable in further investigations in the pathophysiologic and diagnostic roles of inflammatory microRNAs in epilepsy. Furthermore, inflammatory miRNAs regulate critical signaling pathways like TLR4/NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and IL-1β-mediated neuroinflammation. Conclusively, these findings highlight the possibility of using inflammatory miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of epilepsies.",

    "abstract": "Fungal small RNAs (sRNAs) represent a novel class of effector molecules in plant-pathogen interactions. However, understanding of how plants counteract fungal sRNAs-mediated trans-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in plant immunity remains limited. In previous study, a milRNA (Vm-milR1) from Valsa mali can be found to transboundary inhibit the expression of disease-resistance genes MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2 in apple. In this study, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase MdRLKT21 is isolated and characterized, and is confirmed to play a negative regulatory role in the basal immune response. Importantly, MdRLKT21 could hijack Vm-milR1 to rescue the suppression of MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2, and a similar phenomenon is also observed in the interaction between V. mali and pear trees. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that MdRLKT21 can interact with and phosphorylate a C3HC4-type RING finger protein MdRFP1, which positively regulates the apple resistance to V. mali infection. What's more, it is found that MdRLKT21 could inhibit the MdRFP1-mediated immune response, probably by promoting the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of MdRFP1 in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Taken together, it is proposed that an apple susceptibility-related LRR-RLK competitively binds to fungal sRNA effector and subsequently activates defenses by salvaging the expression of MdRLKT1 and MdRLKT2 and thereby releasing the resistance protein MdRFP1.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. During I/R, the accumulation and oxidation of succinate contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, worsening tissue damage. Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3 (HINT3) is identified as a regulator of mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte survival during I/R. In a mouse I/R model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model, it shows that HINT3 expression is downregulated after I/R. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of HINT3 exacerbates myocardial injury, impairs cardiac function, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, whereas HINT3 overexpression mitigates these effects. Mechanistically, HINT3 interacts with succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA), suppresses HDAC1 expression, and prevents SDHA deacetylation at K335, reducing SDH activity and mitochondrial ROS production. These findings highlight the HINT3-HDAC1-SDHA axis as a key pathway in mitochondrial regulation, offering new insights and therapeutic targets for myocardial reperfusion injury.",

In this study, an enhanced mass spectrometry approach is utilized to uncover an unexplored landscape of FAs and FA isomers that are critical for cold tolerance in tomato. This technology integrates N-(4-aminomethylphenyl) pyridium derivatization of FAs, charge-tagging Paternò-Büchi (PB) photochemical reaction to identify carbon-carbon double bond (C═C) positions and reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to achieve efficient detection of FAs and their C═C location isomers. Several saturated FAs, unsaturated FAs and their C═C location isomers are revealed to contribute to the cold tolerance of elongated hypocotyl 5 (slhy5) and fatty acid desaturase (slfad) mutant plants. RNA-sequencing analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assays further demonstrate that SlHY5 can modulate the expression of SlFAD2 genes under cold stress, regulating FA desaturation. The application of FA isomers to the leaves of slfad mutants partially rescues their cold sensitivity, presenting the practical implications of the study. The study thereby highlights the importance of considering isomeric variations in FAs when investigating plant physiology and stress responses. Furthermore, this methodology sets a valuable precedent for future investigations aimed at unraveling the intricate metabolic networks that govern plant stress adaptation.",

Despite these advantages from successful surgery, geriatric patients are at risk of adverse perioperative events, particularly those who are frail. Anatomical and physiological changes due to ageing occur in all organ systems and can have a profound impact on the surgical stress response and recovery. Deciding whether older patients will benefit from surgery can be a difficult task. Due to the diversity of age-related physiological changes and comorbidities in individual patients, differentiation between the fit and the frail elderly is an important step. Despite older age, some studies demonstrated that the odds of a favourable outcome can be improved with preoperative optimisation, leading to better outcomes. Better outcomes are beneficial for patients and can also relieve the growing burden on the healthcare system. A patient-centred care plan, understanding an individual patient's potential risks and integrating a multidisciplinary approach are key principles of good perioperative care. Also, the patient's willingness and short- and long-term goals, such as maintaining functional independence, or pain relief must be considered. However, if surgical treatment is deemed futile and death is to be expected as an unavoidable outcome, multidisciplinary collaboration in guiding patient care and supporting the family can be of great value.

India ranks third globally in egg production, with southern states like Tamil Nadu, a major hub for egg and broiler production. Workers in poultry farms face serious health hazards because of their physically demanding jobs, which include handling heavy loads and performing repetitive motions. Individuals with mental stress often experience higher frequencies of musculoskeletal pain. The physically demanding nature of these jobs exacerbates musculoskeletal pain and fatigue that can affect one's QOL and mental well-being.ObjectiveTo investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain and fatigue and their associations with quality of life and mental health among poultry farm workers.MethodsAn observational study was conducted from May 2024 to July 2024, involving 369 poultry farm workers in southern Tamilnadu district. Data were collected using the Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (Tamil version) to assess musculoskeletal pain, the Fatigue Assessment Scale to measure fatigue levels, the WHOQOL-BREF (Tamil version) to evaluate quality of life, and the GHQ-28 (Tamil version) to assess mental health status.ResultsChi-square analysis showed significant associations between pain and physical QoL (χ² = 203.08), psychological QoL (χ² = 125.25), and mental health (χ² = 196.59) (p < 0.05).
