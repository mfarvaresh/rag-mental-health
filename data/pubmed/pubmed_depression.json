    "abstract": "Black young people in underresourced communities with high levels of violence exposure experience a range of mental health sequelae and barriers to mental health support. In this study, 18 Black young people (ages 12-19) participated in a co-created program to process and cope with the impact of trauma through creative writing activities focused on music production. Participating young people created 20 songs. Song lyrics young people created during the program were the study data source. Using an inductive coding approach and member checking with program participants, three key themes emerged from songs: (1) self-affirmation and self-empowerment, (2) flourishing or personal growth, (3) emotional processing and narrative construction, and (4) disclosure of mental health challenges. The first author, a white woman and non-musician, engaged in reflexivity to account for positionality and center the socio-political contexts and expressive intent of the youth lyricists. Mental health difficulties included externalizing behavior problems (depictions of violence), substance use, exposure to violence, trauma and loss, feelings of mental instability, and depression. Data emphasized the power of such programming to promote unplanned skills building like cognitive restructuring. Altogether, study findings point toward the importance of co-creating curricula with young people to address their mental health needs.",

    "title": "Regulation of Neuroinflammation by Microglial DUBA-IRAK1-IKKβ Signaling Loop.",
    "abstract": "Activation of microglia is closely associated with neuroinflammation. However, the cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms translating microglia activation into neuroinflammation are only partially understood. Here, it is shown that deubiquitinating enzyme A (DUBA) is upregulated in microglia under neuroinflammatory conditions in both mice and humans. Mechanistically, activation of microglia induces DUBA self-deubiquitination and stabilization, leading to the rapid upregulation of DUBA protein levels. In turn, stabilized DUBA increases proinflammatory gene induction in activated microglia by enhancing the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Of note, DUBA promotes NF-κB and MAPK activation by stabilizing interleukin-1 receptor activated kinase 1 (IRAK1) through K48 deubiquitination. Importantly, specific ablation of DUBA in microglia mitigates lipopolysaccharide-induced depression-like behavior and ischemic stroke injury in mice by limiting neuroinflammation. Collectively, these findings establish DUBA as a key regulator of microglia in neuroinflammation and uncover novel molecular mechanisms for DUBA in inflammatory signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Subjective well-being has been implicated in the regulation of aggressive behavior, potentially through its influence on mood and neural processing. However, the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to elucidate the neural correlates of subjective well-being and examine its potential association with aggression using a two-part investigation. The first involved a functional MRI study (n = 111), focusing on amygdala responses to emotional face processing and broader cortical activation related to subjective well-being. The second involved a larger behavioral sample (n = 627) to assess the relationship between subjective well-being and aggression, as well as the mediating role of emotional variables. Behaviorally, subjective well-being was inversely associated with anger, hostility, and overall aggression, and with negative affect, anxiety, and depression. Mediation analyses demonstrated significant effects of mood (negative affect, depression, and anxiety) in linking subjective well-being to aggression. Neuroimaging results revealed that individuals with higher subjective well-being displayed attenuated amygdala reactivity to fearful faces. Additionally, intersubject representational similarity analyses demonstrated that individuals with similar subjective well-being levels shared more convergent neural activation patterns in visual (e.g., occipital pole, lateral occipital cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and fusiform) and the emotional network (e.g., insula), but not within the amygdala. These findings provide novel insights into the neuropsychological mechanisms linking well-being to emotional regulation and aggression.",

Dynamic LED-lighting can mimic daily and seasonal changes in daylight by continuous changes in intensity and spectral distribution throughout the 24-hour day. The current study assessed the clinical effect of dynamic LED-lighting in a randomized controlled setup. In an affective disorders ward, 10 single patient rooms were fitted with a dynamic LED-lighting system, replacing the existing lighting, able to switch between a dynamic or a static mode. In the dynamic mode, daytime Melanopic Daylight Equivalent Illuminance (M-EDI) peaked at 10:30h with 576 lx M-EDI vs. 66 lx in the static mode. During the evening, the dynamic mode gradually reduced intensity to 0.3 lx M-EDI, with the static mode staying at 66 lx. Patients with major depression were randomly allocated to a static or a dynamic lighting mode in their room, lasting three weeks, with weekly assessments, and after 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in scores on the HAM-D6 scale from baseline to week 3. In all, 60 patients were included in the study with a 96.7% follow-up of the primary outcome.

    "title": "Treatment resistant recurrent unipolar and bipolar depression: associative learning abnormalities.",
    "abstract": "Severe and enduring psychiatric illness affects about three percent of the UK population and is associated with significant disability and a substantial reduction in average life expectancy. Two types are treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and treatment resistant bipolar depression, the latter being the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Different phenotypes and different responses to antidepressant medications suggest different neural abnormalities. As bipolar depression can be clinically indistinguishable from unipolar depression yet require different treatments, development of objective ways to discriminate these two illnesses are important. Here we used reinforcement learning drift diffusion models of decision making, and event-related fMRI acquired during a reward gain and loss avoidance task, to investigate patients with treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and bipolar depression, in long term General Adult Psychiatry follow up. We tested the null hypothesis that both unipolar and bipolar depressive illnesses show similarly blunted reward learning signals, and increased loss avoidance learning signals, with similar psychomotor slowing. Consistent with our null hypothesis, we found abnormally slowed decision making for both depression types, with individual patient reinforcement learning drift diffusion model parameter estimates correlating with depression severity. For unipolar depression, we found blunted outcome and value signals for positive feedback, and increased signals for negative feedback. However, in contrast to our null hypothesis, bipolar depression was associated with preserved striatal reward prediction error signalling, and an absence of hippocampal and lateral orbitofrontal enhanced encoding of loss events, which was present for unipolar depression. Overall then, both treatment resistant recurrent unipolar depression and treatment resistant bipolar depression showed a similar pattern of neural abnormality compared to controls for the lateral orbitofrontal cortex reward value signal and the amygdala loss value signal. However, the illnesses also differed significantly, particularly with regard to hippocampal, striatal, and lateral orbitofrontal function, potentially allowing objective discrimination. Using a support vector machine with the results of our neuroimaging analyses, it was also possible to differentiate the two depression types with an accuracy of 74.3%. Further studies of currently ill patients with severe and enduring illness are indicated.",

    "abstract": "Increasing temperatures and water scarcity pose threats to animals living in the wild and humans. Here, we review biological mechanisms animals use to prevent dehydration. Fat and glycogen generate water during metabolism that can be used by many animals as a source of water. In hibernating animals, fat production is stimulated in the autumn by a vasopressin-dependent, carbohydrate-based metabolism that leads to thirst, increased water intake, and storage of glycogen and fat. As fall advances, the animals switch to fat-based metabolism with falling vasopressin levels, and actual entrance into torpor can be triggered when water becomes unavailable and/or unpredictable. Once in torpor, metabolic water is generated by fat metabolism along with a suppression of vasopressin and fall in serum osmolality that blocks thirst. We suggest that water production from fat does not keep up with demands, and that respiratory acidosis also develops as a consequence of hypoventilation, and this leads to the necessity of interbout arousals (IBA), in which the animal rewarms with a switch to carbohydrate metabolism that causes a rapid increase in water availability from the breakdown of glycogen that facilitates the ventilation needed to correct the acidemia. The animal then drops its metabolic rate again, allowing fat metabolism to continue. The observation that water deficit may be a stimulus for fat storage in hibernation carries significance for human obesity, especially in response to salt and sugar, as it suggests that hydration may be protective. These studies also provide an understanding of how glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists may cause weight loss.",
