    "title": "The Head vs the Heart: Comparing Psychoeducation and Emotion Focused Writing as Ways for Bi+ Men to Process Biphobic Experiences.",
    "abstract": "Bi+ men have disproportionately high rates of mental health, physical health and substance use concerns. According to minority stress theory, societal stigma adversely impacts health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals. This study focused on improving health outcomes for bi+ men, a group that has received little focus in the literature outside of focusing on sexual health. The current intervention aimed to help bi+ men process through previous biphobic experiences by exploring two interventions, psychoeducation and emotion focused writing, and evaluated their effectiveness in reducing the impact of biphobic events. To evaluate intervention effectiveness, we measured participants' identity-related concerns, trauma/stressor symptoms, depression levels and gender role norms before and after completing one of the two interventions. Overall, the results suggest that both interventions may be helpful in reducing the impact of biphobic events and improving health outcomes for bi+ populations, with intervention differences in gender role conflict and internalized biphobia. These interventions could be a helpful supplement or alternative to individual therapy to process through biphobic experiences.",

    "title": "Depression and Anxiety in Patients with Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Evaluated by Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES).",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a swallowing disorder frequently assessed using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), which offers detailed visualization of swallowing function. While the physical consequences of OD, such as aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition, are well known, its psychological impact remains less understood. This study aimed to investigate how sociodemographic and clinical factors relate to OD and to evaluate levels of anxiety and depression in affected individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study included 63 patients who underwent FEES to evaluate swallowing function. Psychological status was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on FEES findings, patients were classified into 2 groups: group 1, impaired swallowing, and group 2, normal swallowing. RESULTS Impaired swallowing was identified in 38% of patients. These patients were significantly older (P=0.041) and predominantly male (P=0.005). BDI scores were significantly higher in the impaired group (P=0.044), indicating a greater prevalence of depressive symptoms. No significant difference was observed in BAI scores (P=0.282). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the normal swallowing group had a prior psychiatric diagnosis (P=0.013) and had received psychiatric treatment (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates a significant association between OD and depressive symptoms, underscoring the relevance of incorporating psychological assessment into routine clinical evaluation. These findings advocate for a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the physiological and psychological dimensions of swallowing disorders to enhance patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of this study is to evaluate whether higher emotional distress (depressive symptoms or diabetes distress) was associated with a lower likelihood of basal or rapid-acting insulin initiation among participants enrolled in the GRADE Emotional Distress Substudy (EDS).MethodsIndividuals with type 2 diabetes <10 years duration on metformin alone were randomized to add 1 of 4 glucose-lowering drugs. Per protocol, participants were expected to start basal or rapid-acting insulin rescue therapy after reaching secondary or tertiary glycemic outcomes (A1C >7.5%). Depressive symptoms and diabetes distress were assessed ≤12 months prior to outcome confirmation. Multinomial and binomial logistic regression models examined associations of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress with basal insulin initiation and rapid-acting insulin initiation, respectively.ResultsOf the 525 participants expected to start basal insulin, 30.9% initiated ≤6 weeks, 35.2% initiated >6 weeks, and 33.9% never initiated. Of the 325 participants expected to start rapid-acting insulin, 67.4% never initiated. Neither depressive symptoms nor diabetes distress were associated with starting basal or rapid-acting insulin.ConclusionsIn the GRADE EDS, approximately one-third of participants did not start basal insulin, and two-thirds of participants did not start rapid-acting insulin. Emotional distress did not appear to play a role in insulin initiation among trial participants.",

University students experiencing university lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic may exhibit both horizontal relative deprivation (HRD) and vertical relative deprivation (VRD). Furthermore, as a well-established determinant of depression, relative deprivation (RD) warrants further investigation to determine whether it is associated with exercise, which requires more conclusive evidence. Currently, the available evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions on the relationships between student exercise and depression, RD and subjective exercise experience (SEE). Consequently, this context necessitates a critical re-examination of the exercise-depression relationship and clarification of its underlying mechanistic pathways.",

Co-improvements in green space and air quality significantly mediated 2.7% of this association. Interaction analysis indicated stronger environmental benefits for low-SES populations. Joint analysis revealed that low-SES adults in favorable environments had a 14.6% lower depression risk than medium-SES individuals in unfavorable conditions, with more pronounced effects among females (16.4%) and older adults (9.8%). Our findings emphasize mitigating role of upstream environmental factors involving green space and air quality in tackling socioeconomic inequalities in depression, particularly for vulnerable populations like the elderly and females.",

This study aimed to validate MDD subtypes based on IQ trajectories and to elucidate their cognitive and multimodal neuroimaging characteristics. Premorbid IQ was estimated using a validated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-based algorithm and compared to current IQ to classify patients. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted, and multimodal neuroimaging analyses included measurements of gray matter volume and low-frequency fluctuation amplitude. A total of 164 MDD patients with preserved IQ (PIQ), 67 MDD patients with deteriorated IQ (DIQ), and 353 healthy controls (HCs) participated in the study. The DIQ group exhibited poorer performance on logical memory and executive function tasks compared to the PIQ group. Patients with IQ decline exhibited greater cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging results revealed reduced gray matter volume and increased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, with distinct patterns observed between PIQ and DIQ groups. Using K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), we achieved an accuracy of 0.6442 and an area under the curve of 0.8023 for predicting cognitive changes. These findings confirm the cognitive heterogeneity in depression, highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Portable wearable robots offer promise for assisting people with upper limb disabilities. However, movement variability between individuals and trade-offs between supportiveness and transparency complicate robot control during real-world tasks. We address these challenges by first developing a personalized ML intention detection model to decode user's motion intention from IMU and compression sensors. Second, we leverage a physics-based hysteresis model to enhance control transparency and adapt it for practical use in real-world tasks. Third, we combine and integrate these two models into a real-time controller to modulate the assistance level based on the user's intention and kinematic state. Fourth, we evaluate the effectiveness of our control strategy in improving arm function in a multi-day evaluation. For 5 individuals post-stroke and 4 living with ALS wearing a soft shoulder robot, we demonstrate that the controller identifies shoulder movement with 94.2% accuracy from minimal change in the shoulder angles (elevation: 3.4°, depression: 1.7°) and reduces arm-lowering force by 31.9% compared to a baseline controller. Furthermore, the robot improves movement quality by increasing their shoulder elevation/depression (17.5°), elbow (10.6°) and wrist flexion/extension (7.6°) ROMs; reducing trunk compensation (up to 25.4%); and improving hand-path efficiency (up to 53.8%).",

Among the soil microbes, Streptomyces rimosus is known to produce geosmin, which have a unique odor and positive effects on mental status. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the effects of direct exposure to soil containing S. rimosus on depression-like behavior and depression-related factors in the mouse. To induce depression, the mice were exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 14 days, and direct soil exposure continued for 17 days from the first day of CRS. The results showed that direct exposure to soil containing S. rimosus alleviated the CRS-induced depression-like behavior. Additionally, S. rimosus-rich soil exposure reduced the activation of microglia and astrocyte in the depression-related brain area, and reduced the mRNA expression levels of cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, interferon-γ, and IL-17 A. Moreover, S. rimosus-rich soil contact increased synaptic plasticity, which was reduced by CRS. The same effects were not observed in the group exposed to sterilized soil. Collectively, the current study suggests that S. rimosus soil contact can be a beneficial psychological therapeutic strategy for patients with mental illnesses.",

    "abstract": "Torsion of the ovary is a gynecologic emergency that occurs when the ovary and fallopian tube rotate around the infundibulopelvic ligament, causing ischemic changes in the adnexa. Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in treatment-resistant depression and has fewer side effects than other antidepressants. In this study, the protective effect of tianeptine on ovarian ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in female rats was evaluated. Four groups were created from twenty-four female albino Wistar rats before surgery (n = 6/each group): TPG (5 mg/kg/orally tianeptine-only), SG (sham operation), OIR (ovarian I/R), and TOIR (5 mg/kg/orally tianeptine + I/R). One hour before surgery procedures, the TPG and TOIR applied tianeptine. Tianeptine administration procedure was repeated once daily for six days. Under 60 mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) ketamine and sevoflurane (inhaler) anesthesia, the right ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vessels in the OIR and TOIR groups were clamped by torsion. After 3 h of ischemia, a 6-day reperfusion period was started. Tianeptine administration procedure was repeated once daily for six days. In the SG group, the abdominal cavity was opened and closed with sutures without any intervention on the ovaries. On the seventh day, rats were sacrificed (120 mg/kg ketamine, IP), and ovaries were extracted. Levels of oxidants (malondialdehyde), antioxidants (total glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6) were measured in excised ovarian tissue. Ovarian tissues also examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically. I/R increased the levels of oxidants and pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased the levels of antioxidants in rat ovaries. In parallel, histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination of the ovarian tissue revealed the presence of severe (grade 3) oxidative damage. Tianeptine significantly suppressed oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine increases related with I/R in the ovarian tissue, while also alleviating histopathological damage and oxidative DNA damage. Our experimental results suggest that tianeptine treatment may be effective against I/R-induced ovarian injury.",

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a common condition, yet multifactorial in nature. Our understanding of the interplay between clinical symptoms in relation to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and quality of life is limited. Our primary objective therefore was to identify features of TMD that contribute to anxiety and depression. Our secondary objective was to determine whether clinical symptoms, baseline characteristics, and mental health outcomes are associated with underlying disease severity, as determined by MRI. A retrospective analysis of 202 TMD patients was performed. Mental health outcomes were quantified using the Integrating Mental and Physical Healthcare: Research, Training and Services (IMPARTS) questionnaires, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and pain was judged by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Patients were categorised based on the severity of temporomandibular joint pathology (normal, anterior disc displacement with reduction, anterior disc displacement without reduction, and severe degeneration). On multivariate analyses, both higher anxiety (GAD-7) (p < 0.001) and depression (PHQ-9) (p < 0.001) scores on the IMPARTS assessment were associated with worst perceived pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Unilateral joint involvement (OR 2.48; 95% CI 1.20 to 5.46; p = 0.018), locking (OR 4.28; 95% CI 1.63 to 13.63; p = 0.006), and clicking (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.60; p = 0.006) were significantly associated with increased odds of an abnormal TMJ on MRI, whereas higher anxiety scores (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; p = 0.006) and male gender (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; p = 0.012) were statistically significantly indicative of a normal joint morphology on MRI.

Despite policy advancements, MST remains prevalent, with profound implications for mental and physical health. MST encompasses sexual assault and harassment, affecting 38% of women and 4% of men in the military. It is linked to higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance use disorders, and physical health issues such as cardiovascular disease and chronic pain. In addition, MST survivors face social functional impairments, including difficulties in family relationships, occupational performance, and educational achievements. The military environment, characterized by close living quarters and hierarchical power dynamics, exacerbates the risk and consequences of MST. Survivors often experience institutional betrayal and fear of retaliation, hindering reporting and access to support. Effective interventions must address these unique challenges, emphasizing trauma-informed care, social support, and systemic changes to promote gender equity and accountability. Leveraging technology, such as mobile applications and online interventions, can enhance access to care and support for MST survivors. Comprehensive prevention and intervention strategies, coupled with policy reforms and cultural shifts within the military, are crucial for mitigating the impacts of MST and supporting the recovery and well-being of women veterans. The objective of this narrative review is to examine the health impacts and systemic challenges of MST among women veterans, advocating for trauma-informed care and policy reform.",
